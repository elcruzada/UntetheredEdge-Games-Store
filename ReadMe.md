#About
---

This website uses Epic Games Store as inspiration for the layout and features. Users have a developer portal where they can create game information on the website, view what they have created, update the information, and delete the information as if they were developers publishing on the platform.  Users can also CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE comments on the games. There is also a cart feature that allows users to add games to a cart and check them out. In the account page, users can view a transaction history of their orders.
